# findall README

This extension searches the search text in active open document. The results are shown in a new document with links over search text. The links are very useful to open the target location, where the search text is located.

This extension does not work well with Remote-SSH extension. When file is opened using Remote-SSH, link shown in the search results not working properly. Please, refer [#2352](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/2352) for more information.
